    <h1>Bermuda Lawn Care in Garner, NC</h1>
    <p>Bermuda Kept serves homeowners in Garner, North Carolina and select surrounding communities in Wake County. Our membership is limited to ensure every lawn receives the attention it deserves.</p>

    <h2>Why Bermuda Grass Thrives in Garner, NC</h2>
    <p>Garner sits in the North Carolina Piedmont — a region with long, hot summers and moderate winters that make it ideal territory for warm-season Bermuda grass. With average summer highs in the low 90s and a growing season that stretches from April through October, Bermuda has the heat and sunlight exposure it needs to produce dense, vigorous turf.</p>

    <p>The Piedmont's transition zone climate means Bermuda will go dormant in winter, turning brown from roughly November through March. But with proper fall preparation and spring scalping, a well-maintained Bermuda lawn in Garner greens up quickly and stays dense throughout the growing season.</p>

    <h2>Garner's Soil: What It Means for Your Lawn</h2>
    <p>Most properties in Garner and Wake County sit on Cecil clay soil — a well-drained but heavy red clay common throughout the Carolina Piedmont. Clay soil holds nutrients well but compacts easily, which can restrict root growth and water infiltration for Bermuda grass.</p>

    <p>That's why our program includes soil testing through NC State's lab and why we recommend core aeration for properties with compaction issues. Understanding your specific soil conditions is essential to building a fertilization and amendment program that actually works — not a generic plan that ignores the realities of Wake County clay.</p>

    <h2>Communities We Serve</h2>
    <p>Bermuda Kept is based in Garner, NC, and our primary service area covers Garner and nearby communities in southern Wake County.</p>

    <div class="area-communities">
      <span class="community-tag">Garner</span>
      <span class="community-tag">South Garner</span>
      <span class="community-tag">White Oak</span>
      <span class="community-tag">Auburn</span>
      <span class="community-tag">Cleveland</span>

    <p>Because we limit our membership to maintain quality, we may not be able to accept properties far outside our core Garner service area. If you're nearby but not sure if you're within range, apply to the waitlist and we'll let you know.</p>

    <h2>Bermuda Grass vs. Fescue in the Triangle</h2>
    <p>Many homeowners in the Raleigh-Durham Triangle area grow tall fescue — a cool-season grass that looks great in fall and spring but struggles through hot Piedmont summers. Fescue requires overseeding every year, heavy watering to survive July and August, and is prone to brown patch disease.</p>

    <p>Bermuda grass is the opposite. It thrives in heat, recovers from drought quickly thanks to its deep root system, and spreads aggressively to fill in bare spots. In the Garner, NC climate, a properly maintained Bermuda lawn outperforms fescue in durability, density, and long-term cost of maintenance. That said, Bermuda needs full sun — at least 7 to 8 hours of direct sunlight daily. Shaded properties may not be a fit.</p>

    <h2>The Bermuda Kept Difference in Garner</h2>
    <p>Most lawn care companies in the Triangle treat every lawn the same — same mow height, same fertilizer, same schedule, whether you have Bermuda, fescue, or zoysia. We do one thing: Bermuda grass. Every decision we make — from mowing height to fertilizer timing to pre-emergent selection — is specific to how Bermuda performs in Garner's Piedmont climate and Wake County soils.</p>

    <p>That focus is what allows us to keep a limited roster and deliver results that generalist services can't match.</p>
