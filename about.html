    <h1>About Bermuda Kept</h1>
    <p style="max-width: 600px; font-size: 1.1rem; color: var(--color-text-light);">A different kind of lawn care service. One grass type. One service area. Done right.</p>

<section class="section">
  <div class="container about-content">

    <p>Most lawn care companies try to be everything to everyone — mowing fescue in the morning, spraying zoysia after lunch, and squeezing in a mulch job before dark. Every lawn gets the same treatment regardless of grass type, soil conditions, or what the turf actually needs that week.</p>

    <p>Bermuda Kept exists because we think that approach leaves a lot on the table. Bermuda grass has specific needs — specific mowing heights, specific fertilization timing, specific weed pressures — that differ from every other grass type grown in the North Carolina Piedmont. When you treat Bermuda like fescue, you get mediocre results. When you treat it like Bermuda, you get something exceptional.</p>

    <h2>The Approach</h2>

    <p>We maintain a limited number of properties in the Garner, NC area. That constraint is intentional. A smaller roster means more time per lawn, better attention to detail, and the ability to adjust our schedule based on what the turf needs — not what a route optimization algorithm says.</p>

    <p>Every decision we make is informed by soil data, weather conditions, and the specific growth stage of Bermuda grass in the Wake County climate. We don't spray on a calendar. We don't mow on a clock. We care for your lawn based on what it tells us it needs, and we keep you informed along the way with monthly reports and photos.</p>

    <h2>Why Waitlist-Only</h2>

    <p>We cap our membership because quality scales slower than demand. Taking on too many properties means rushed visits, missed details, and generic care — exactly what we built Bermuda Kept to avoid. The waitlist ensures we only onboard new members when we have the capacity to serve them at the standard we set for ourselves.</p>

    <p>If you are on the waitlist, you are not forgotten. When a spot opens in your area, we will reach out.</p>
