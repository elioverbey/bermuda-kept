      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">What height should Bermuda grass be mowed in Garner, NC?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Bermuda grass in Garner should be maintained between 1 and 2.5 inches, depending on the variety. Common Bermuda does well at 1.5 to 2.5 inches, while hybrid varieties like Tifway 419 can be maintained lower with a reel mower. The key is consistency — we never remove more than one-third of the blade in a single cut. During peak summer growth, that often means mowing more than once per week.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">When should I fertilize Bermuda grass in North Carolina?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>In Garner and the NC Piedmont, Bermuda grass should be fertilized from May through September. The first application should come several weeks after the lawn has fully greened up — usually by early May. Monthly nitrogen applications continue through mid-August, with a final fall application in September. NC State Extension recommends half to one pound of nitrogen per thousand square feet per application for Bermuda in the Piedmont.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">When should pre-emergent be applied in Garner, NC?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>The spring pre-emergent window in Garner typically opens in late February to early March, when soil temperatures approach 55 degrees — the point at which crabgrass begins to germinate. A second fall pre-emergent application in September targets winter annual weeds. Two rounds per year provides the most comprehensive weed prevention for Bermuda lawns in Wake County.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Is Bermuda grass good for clay soil in Wake County?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Bermuda grass actually performs quite well on the Cecil clay soils common throughout Garner and Wake County. Its aggressive root system can penetrate clay over time, especially when you incorporate annual core aeration to relieve compaction. Clay holds nutrients well, which benefits Bermuda's heavy nitrogen demands. The main challenge is drainage — clay can hold too much water after heavy rain, but Bermuda's tolerance for a range of conditions makes it a strong fit.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">How much water does Bermuda grass need per week?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Bermuda grass needs about one inch of water per week during the active growing season. In Garner, NC, supplemental irrigation is most important from June through August. We recommend watering deeply and infrequently — two to three long sessions per week rather than daily short runs. This encourages deep root growth, which is what makes Bermuda so drought-tolerant compared to cool-season grasses like fescue.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">When does Bermuda grass go dormant in North Carolina?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>In Garner, Bermuda grass typically enters dormancy in late October to November when soil temperatures drop below 50 degrees. The lawn turns brown and remains dormant through the winter. It greens up again in mid-to-late April as soil temperatures rise consistently above 55 degrees. Dormancy is completely normal and healthy — it is not dying, just resting.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Should I scalp my Bermuda lawn in spring?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Yes. Spring scalping is one of the most important annual maintenance events for a Bermuda lawn in Garner. By lowering the mowing height and removing dormant top growth in late March to early April, you expose the soil to sunlight and warm it faster — which accelerates green-up. Scalping also removes dead material that can harbor fungal issues. Timing should be based on soil temperature, not the calendar.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Why does Bermuda grass outperform fescue in Garner?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Garner's summers are simply too hot and long for tall fescue to thrive without heavy intervention. Fescue goes dormant or dies in July and August heat, requires annual overseeding, and is susceptible to brown patch disease. Bermuda grass peaks during the hottest months, recovers from drought quickly, and spreads to fill bare spots on its own. For overall turf performance and lower long-term cost, Bermuda wins in the Garner climate.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Does Bermuda grass grow in shade?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Bermuda grass needs full sun — a minimum of 7 to 8 hours of direct sunlight daily. It does not perform well in shade. If your property in Garner has significant tree cover, you may see thin or bare areas under the canopy. In those cases, selective tree trimming to increase light exposure may help, or a shade-tolerant alternative for those specific areas may be a better fit.</p>

      <h4>About Bermuda Kept</h4>
      <h2>How membership works</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-list">

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">How does the waitlist work?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Bermuda Kept maintains a limited membership to ensure every property gets the attention it deserves. You apply through our waitlist form with your property information — address, estimated lawn size, and any details about your current turf. When a spot opens in your area of Garner, we reach out to schedule a property assessment. Membership is offered on a first-come, first-served basis by geographic area.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">What is included in the monthly membership?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Every membership includes precision mowing at the correct height and frequency, a full-season fertilization program based on soil test results, weed spot treatment during every visit, seasonal scalping, one to two soil tests per year, and monthly lawn reports with photos. Your membership covers the complete care your Bermuda lawn needs to stay dense, healthy, and green throughout the growing season.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Are there contracts or long-term commitments?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>No long-term contracts. Membership is billed monthly during the active growing season. We ask for a minimum commitment of one full season so we can implement the program and show results, but you are not locked into a multi-year agreement. Off-season billing is reduced since active maintenance is paused during Bermuda dormancy.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">What areas do you serve?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Bermuda Kept serves Garner, NC and select surrounding communities in southern Wake County, including South Garner, White Oak, Auburn, Cleveland, and parts of Fuquay-Varina, Holly Springs, and South Raleigh. Because we limit our roster, we may not accept properties far outside our core service area.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Do you only work on Bermuda grass?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Yes. Bermuda Kept is exclusively a Bermuda grass lawn care service. We do not maintain fescue, zoysia, centipede, or mixed-species lawns. This specialization is what allows us to deliver expert-level results. If your lawn is primarily Bermuda with some other species present, we can discuss it during the property assessment.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">How is pricing determined?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Membership pricing is based on your maintained turf area — the actual square footage of Bermuda grass, not your total lot size. Plans start at $199 per month for lawns up to 3,000 square feet and scale from there. Add-on services like pre-emergent, mulch, and topdressing are priced separately. Full pricing details are provided during the onboarding process.</p>
