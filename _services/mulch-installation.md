Fresh mulch does more than make your beds look good. It retains moisture, suppresses weeds, moderates soil temperature, and protects root systems — all of which complement a well-maintained Bermuda lawn. In Garner's hot summers, a properly mulched landscape reduces watering needs and keeps your property looking polished from the curb.

Bermuda Kept offers mulch installation as an add-on service for members. We handle everything from bed prep to clean edging and installation at the correct depth.

## Materials Available

We offer several mulch options to match your property's aesthetic and functional needs. Hardwood mulch is a durable, natural-looking option that decomposes slowly and enriches the soil over time. Pine bark mulch is lightweight, slightly acidic, and a great choice for beds with azaleas, camellias, or other acid-loving plants common in Garner landscapes. Dyed mulch — black, brown, or red — holds its color longer and provides a sharper contrast against green turf.

We source our mulch in bulk from local suppliers in the Wake County area, keeping material costs down and quality consistent.

## How We Install

Before spreading new mulch, we edge every bed with a clean, defined line that separates your Bermuda turf from the landscape beds. Old mulch is assessed — if it's decomposed to a thin layer, we install directly over it. If buildup is excessive, we'll remove the top layer before adding fresh material.

Mulch is installed at a depth of 2 to 3 inches — enough to suppress weeds and retain moisture without suffocating root systems. We keep mulch pulled back from tree trunks and plant stems to prevent rot and disease.

## When to Mulch in Garner, NC

The best time to refresh mulch in Garner is early spring, after winter cleanup and before the growing season kicks in. A second application in late fall can help insulate root systems heading into winter. Most properties benefit from one to two mulch refreshes per year.
