If your Bermuda lawn has bumps, dips, or uneven areas, topdressing is the solution. It involves applying a thin layer of sand or sand-compost mix across the turf surface, filling in low spots and gradually leveling the ground over time. For Bermuda grass, which spreads aggressively via stolons and rhizomes, topdressing also encourages lateral growth and produces a thicker, more uniform lawn.

In Garner, NC, where clay soils are common, topdressing with sand can also improve drainage and reduce compaction at the surface level — both of which benefit Bermuda grass root health.

## How It Works

We apply a layer of clean, washed sand (or a sand-compost blend, depending on your soil test results) evenly across the lawn, then work it into the canopy using a drag mat or leveling rake. The goal is to fill in minor depressions while keeping the grass blades exposed above the material.

For lawns with significant low spots, we may apply heavier amounts in targeted areas. Severely uneven lawns may require multiple topdressing sessions over a season for the best results — Bermuda is resilient and recovers quickly between applications.

## Best Timing for Garner, NC

Topdressing is most effective during Bermuda's active growth period — late May through July in the Garner area. The warm soil temperatures and vigorous growth allow the turf to recover quickly and grow through the topdressing material. We avoid topdressing during dormancy or during the early spring transition when the grass is still waking up.

## Who Needs This

If your lawn mower scalps certain areas but not others, if water pools in spots after rain, or if you can feel bumps and ridges when walking across the turf — your lawn would benefit from topdressing. It's also an excellent follow-up to core aeration, as the sand fills aeration holes and improves soil structure deeper into the root zone.
