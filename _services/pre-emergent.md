Pre-emergent herbicides are one of the most effective tools in Bermuda lawn care. Applied before weed seeds germinate, they create a chemical barrier in the top layer of soil that prevents crabgrass, goosegrass, and other summer annual weeds from establishing.

For Bermuda lawns in Garner, NC, a well-timed pre-emergent program is the difference between a clean, dense turf and a lawn fighting weeds all summer.

## When to Apply in Garner, NC

Timing is critical. In the Garner and Wake County area, soil temperatures typically reach the 55°F threshold for crabgrass germination between late February and mid-March. That's when the spring pre-emergent window opens.

We apply the first spring round in late February to early March, before soil temps hit that germination point. A second application follows in late summer or early fall to catch winter annual weeds and any late-season crabgrass pressure.

## What We Use

We select professional-grade pre-emergent herbicides — typically prodiamine or dithiopyr-based products — that are labeled for use on Bermuda grass. Product selection depends on your lawn's specific weed pressure and history. We rotate modes of action to reduce the risk of herbicide resistance over time.

## Two-Round Seasonal Package

Most Bermuda lawns in Garner benefit from two pre-emergent applications per year: one in early spring and one in early fall. We offer a two-round package at a bundled rate for members who want full-season weed prevention without thinking about timing.

## Why It Matters

Once crabgrass or goosegrass germinates in your Bermuda lawn, it's exponentially harder and more expensive to deal with. Post-emergent control is less effective and more disruptive to your turf. A proactive pre-emergent program costs less, works better, and keeps your Bermuda clean all season long.
