Bermuda grass needs about one inch of water per week during the growing season — but how that water is delivered matters just as much as the amount. Poorly configured irrigation systems create dry spots, overwatered zones, runoff, and fungal issues. In Garner's hot summers, an inefficient system wastes water and money while leaving parts of your turf stressed.

An irrigation audit evaluates every aspect of your system's performance and gives you a clear picture of what's working, what's not, and what to fix.

## What We Evaluate

During the audit, we run each zone of your irrigation system and assess head-to-head coverage, spray patterns, head alignment, and pressure consistency. We check for clogged nozzles, broken heads, misting caused by high pressure, and gaps in coverage.

We also evaluate your current run times and scheduling. Many homeowners in Garner water too frequently for too short a duration — which promotes shallow root growth in Bermuda grass. We recommend schedules based on deep, infrequent watering to encourage the deep root system that makes Bermuda so drought-tolerant.

## What You Receive

After the audit, you'll receive a written report with our findings, a zone-by-zone assessment, and specific recommendations for adjustments. This might include head replacements, nozzle changes, run time adjustments, or suggestions for adding coverage in dry areas.

We don't perform irrigation repairs — but we can recommend trusted irrigation contractors in the Garner and Wake County area if work is needed.

## When to Schedule

The best time for an irrigation audit in Garner, NC is late spring, just as Bermuda enters its peak water demand period. This gives you time to make any adjustments before the hottest months of summer. We also recommend an audit if you've noticed persistent dry patches, uneven growth, or if your system hasn't been evaluated in more than two years.
