Bermuda grass doesn't respond well to a set-it-and-forget-it mowing schedule. Its growth rate changes dramatically with soil temperature, rainfall, and the time of year. In Garner, NC, that means your mowing needs shift from weekly spring cuts to twice-weekly summer maintenance — and back down as dormancy approaches in late fall.

Bermuda Kept's mowing program is built around how Bermuda actually grows in the Wake County Piedmont region, not a generic calendar.

## What's Included

Your mowing program includes precision cutting at the correct height for your Bermuda variety — typically between 1 and 2.5 inches, depending on whether you're growing a common or hybrid Bermuda. We adjust mowing frequency based on growth rate, never removing more than one-third of the blade in a single cut.

Every mowing visit also includes clean edging along hardscapes and beds, trimming, and clipping management. During peak summer growth in Garner, you can expect weekly or more frequent visits. During slower shoulder seasons, we scale back accordingly.

## Spring Scalping

Each spring, we perform a seasonal scalp — lowering the mowing height to remove dormant top growth and open the canopy to sunlight. In Garner, NC, this is typically timed to late March or early April, depending on soil temperatures. Scalping is one of the most important annual events for a Bermuda lawn and dramatically impacts how quickly and evenly your turf greens up.

## Why It Matters

Bermuda grass maintained at the wrong height becomes thin, leggy, and prone to weed invasion. Mowed too infrequently, it develops thatch problems. Mowed too short without the right equipment, it scalps unevenly. Consistent, informed mowing is the single biggest factor in how your Bermuda lawn looks and performs in the Garner, NC climate.
