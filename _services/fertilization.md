Bermuda grass is a heavy feeder — it needs consistent nitrogen throughout the growing season to maintain density, color, and vigor. But more isn't always better. Over-fertilizing leads to excessive thatch, disease pressure, and environmental runoff. Under-fertilizing leaves your turf thin and vulnerable to weeds.

Bermuda Kept's fertilization program is driven by soil test data, not guesswork. Every application is timed to Bermuda's growth cycles in the Garner, NC Piedmont climate.

## How Our Program Works

We start with a soil test through NC State's soil testing lab. The results tell us your soil's pH, phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrient levels — and exactly what amendments your Bermuda lawn needs.

From there, we build a 4-to-6-application schedule that runs from late spring green-up through early fall. Nitrogen is applied at the rate of approximately half a pound to one pound per thousand square feet per application, following NC State Extension guidelines for Bermuda grass in the Piedmont region.

## Timing for Garner, NC

In Garner, Bermuda typically breaks dormancy in mid-to-late April. We begin fertilization several weeks after full green-up — usually by early May. Applications continue monthly through mid-August, with a final fall application in September to help the turf store energy before winter dormancy.

We do not fertilize dormant Bermuda. Applying nitrogen before the turf is actively growing wastes product and increases runoff — especially on Garner's clay-heavy Cecil soils.

## What Makes It Different

Most lawn care companies use the same generic fertilizer blend on every lawn, regardless of grass type or soil conditions. We adjust formulations based on your soil test results, apply at rates specific to Bermuda grass, and time every application to soil temperature and growth stage. That's the difference between a fertilized lawn and a properly fed Bermuda lawn.
